# Global Risk Monitoring Dashboard

## Overview
The **Global Risk Monitoring Dashboard** is a prototype system designed to track **geopolitical events and security incidents** using open-source intelligence feeds. It applies **risk assessment frameworks** to evaluate potential business impact and provides structured reporting for advisory decision-making.

## Features
- **Risk Assessment**: Implements CVSS/NIST scoring models to quantify security and geopolitical risks.  
- **Geopolitical Analysis**: Monitors global events and integrates threat intelligence feeds for real-time awareness.  
- **Threat Intelligence**: Correlates incident data with geopolitical context to highlight emerging risks.  
- **Structured Reporting**: Generates CSV/JSON outputs and visual dashboards for decision support.  

## Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python, SQL  
- **Data Handling**: Pandas, JSON/CSV processing  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib/Seaborn (for dashboards)  
- **Sources**: Open-source intelligence feeds, public APIs  

## Use Cases
- Security teams can monitor **global risk trends** and assess potential impact on operations.  
- Analysts can generate **structured reports** for management and advisory functions.  
- Supports **rotational environments** by providing clear, automated insights into geopolitical and security risks.  

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with **Splunk/ELK** for advanced log correlation.  
- Expansion to include **machine learning models** for predictive risk scoring.  
- Automated alerting for high-impact geopolitical events.
